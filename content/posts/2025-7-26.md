A young woman named Yin dreams of leaving her modest village life for a chance to try to make it big as a martial arts movie star. Leaving for the big city with her boyfriend, life takes a turn for poor Yin when she soon finds herself addicted to drugs and being pimped out by her boyfriend. After a violent altercation forces Yin to flee to Hong Kong, it's not long before she ends up on the radar of the police. Without any other options, Yin makes a deal with the police to go undercover with one of their straight-laced female detectives, Hung, in order to try and bring down a notorious drug dealer nicknamed "King Kong". Victimized by the men in their lives, the two unlikely friends must team up to protect each other from the criminals out to get them and work together to get revenge on those who have betrayed them.
